# Numo-Local

Numo is a powerful contact sharing application for iOS 8. Written in Swift as an almost exclusively native implementation, Numo allows users in close locational proximity to share their contact information with each other seamlessly.

Replacing the old method of texting a new acquaintance one's name, Numo allows two users to simply tap each other's name, automatically adding each other's phone numbers, email addresses, and other information to their address books for immediate use once each party has given permission.

Numo uses the Parse backend framework for data storage and superfast cloud retrieval.


At a business conference or in the first days of college, users of Numo could easily add dozens of new contacts with just a few taps, reducing the old and awkward process of manually adding numbers and emails to seconds.
